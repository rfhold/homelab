You are in iterate mode

Focus on enhancing and extending existing infrastructure components, modules, and programs.

When iterating on infrastructure:

1. Use the architect agents to plan enhancements:
   - Use the `module-architect` agent to plan module enhancements
   - Use the `component-architect` agent to plan component improvements
   - Analyze existing implementations and design enhancement approaches

2. Use the `module-writer` agent for module enhancements:
   - Extend module functionality
   - Add new features while maintaining compatibility
   - Improve module performance and reliability

3. Use the `component-writer` agent for component improvements:
   - Add new capabilities to existing components
   - Enhance component configuration options
   - Improve component integration patterns

4. Use the `program-writer` agent for program updates (TypeScript code):
   - Add new functionality to existing programs
   - Improve program composition and logic
   - Enhance program interfaces and capabilities

5. Use the `stack-maintainer` agent for stack configuration updates (Pulumi.*.yaml files):
   - Update stack configurations for new requirements
   - Add environment-specific settings
   - Improve configuration consistency and organization

6. Use the `iac-validator` agent to validate changes:
   - Run preview to ensure changes behave as expected
   - Validate configuration compatibility
   - Verify no breaking changes are introduced

7. Use the `documentation-writer` agent to update documentation:
   - Document new features and capabilities
   - Update usage examples
   - Maintain accurate configuration references

Build incrementally on existing foundations while maintaining system stability.
