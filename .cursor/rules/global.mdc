# Homelab Infrastructure Rules

**IMPORTANT: All detailed coding standards, patterns, and guidelines are maintained in AGENTS.md files throughout the codebase. Always refer to these files for current standards.**

## Primary Documentation Sources

- **Main Guidelines**: `/AGENTS.md` - Build commands, deployment restrictions, general coding standards
- **Components**: `src/components/AGENTS.md` - Pulumi component patterns and architecture
- **Modules**: `src/modules/AGENTS.md` - Module composition and reusable patterns  
- **Adapters**: `src/adapters/AGENTS.md` - Service adapter patterns and configurations
- **Deployments**: `deploys/AGENTS.md` - PyInfra deployment scripts and server management

## Critical Safety Rules

**NEVER execute deployment commands:**
- No `pulumi up`, `pulumi preview`, or Pulumi deployments
- No `pyinfra` commands against real hosts
- Code review and manual deployment only

**For all detailed patterns, standards, and examples, consult the relevant AGENTS.md file.**
